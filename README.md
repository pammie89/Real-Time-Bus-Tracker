## Description of the Project 
I chose to use the real-time bus route that runs daily from M.I.T. to Harvard. The live feed shows the location and direction that each bus is traveling in real-time. In this exercise, we learned how to fetch data via an external API to provide real-time bus tracking details. This was a very cool assignment, and despite its challenges; I submitted a customized version of the assignment. The customizations included personalized styles to the map layout and custom-created bus icons.

## How to Run
Once you copy all the files, you just open the index.html.  It is an automatic load.  It refreshes every 15 seconds.  Every time it refreshes it will show where the buses are now currently located.

## Roadmap of future improvements
- I would like to do the same project but for trains
- I would like to redesign the icons and create a state that shows the bus number.
